## üéØProject Overview

    - Overview
    KuPay was founded on the belief that the traditional economy with its assets and financial products
    is past its expiration date. Central banks and governments are manipulating the markets and the value
    of money. Banks are making lots of money off consumers and merchants by keeping their assets and
    making profits on it which should have gone to the rightful owner: the party that is taking the risks
    being the entrepreneurs and the consumers. KuPay is here to change all that, allowing its users to get
    the maximum value out of their assets. KuPay will be a one stop platform for earning, storing, swapping
    and trading connecting the traditional financial system to the KCC.

    - Project Details
    KuPay will be a platform for financial services bridging KCC to the traditional commercial/fInancial system.
    On the platform users will be able to:
      * Sign their businesses up for our KCC based Shopify/Woocommerce payment system
        adding KuPay Checkout to their website, allowing them to receive any KCC based token as a currency of payment.
      * Generate and send payment requests to other KCC users using the KuPay Payment Request app.
      * Track prices of all KCC based tokens via the KuPay Volatility Tracker bot on Telegram,
        as well as charts and info pages on the KuPay website
      * Swapping KCC based tokens and staking the platform home token ($KUPAY) to be eligible
        for receiving the NFT shares ($sKUPAY) airdrop.
      * Investing and trading the project NFT shares giving the virtual owners rights in the platform.
        Being the holder of NFT shares will give rights to receive part of the company profits
        in the platform's home token.

    - Legal Structure
    KuPay starts off as a 'sole proprietorship' in the name of our project lead KPAgent. This is necessary
    because we are connecting the traditional financial world with all its tax regulations to the KCC Blockchain.
    When we are ready to launch KuPay token we will switch to an LTD. Eventually the shares in the LTD will be
    directly connected to the holders of the NFT shares as soon as this is technically possible. Within the LTD
    we will switch to a DAO when reaching that milestone with voting rights for the holders of the NFT shares.

## üì°Future Plans

    Once the KuPay platform is fully operational we will focus on connecting more users to the platform.
    We are aiming to make KuPay Checkout a standard preferred payment method for both Shopify and Woocommerce.

    For KuPay Payment Requests we will expand to different chains advertising the low transaction fees at
    the homebase of KuPay convincing users to make the transition to KCC.

    For the NFT Trading platform we will focus on attracting other businesses to follow KuPay in giving out
    NFT-shares which will be tradeable on the KuPay platform. We want to connect to regulators
    giving the shares an official status. In that process we are also aiming to become a FIAT bridge directly to KCC.

## üôãAdditional Information ‚ûï

    KuPay in itself is a bridge between traditional finance/commerce and DeFi. KuPay will focus on customer
    satisfaction, being one of the main pillars to run a successful business.

    KuPay will exist by the satisfaction of their users. KuPay will be transparent in all its decisions and
    actions and will be completely honest in its communication providing information to the community when
    it is needed, making the transition to being a DAO as the end goal, a small step.

    The KuPay team will enrich their workforce in the process of reaching the mentioned goals and will be
    selecting workers on fitting the above mentioned profile.

    Another condition that needs to be fulfilled for KuPay to be succesful is widespread adoption of the KCC.
    For this reason we have budgeted a significant portion of the funding for marketing.
    KuPay will not only focus on bringing existing crypto enthusiasts to KCC, but also
    traditional merchants and buyers.

    Social media/communication channels will also be very important instruments in reaching our goals
    and will be used responsibly.

    KuPay will add a very small fee to every transaction. Profits of the platform will be used to buy back
    the platform's home token and the NFT shares, adding value to the project.

    KuPay is here to stay, to grow and to be a very valuable asset for KCC.
