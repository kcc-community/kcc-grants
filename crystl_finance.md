## üéØProject Overview

          - Overview - Why Crystl Finance
          To set ourselves apart from and exceed our competitors, we have developed novel code where we are able to create strategies on top of strategies for vaults. Essentially, we can choose the principal LP/tokens staked as well as the tokens/LPs earned. This means we can create strategies where users can stake the tokens they want and earn the tokens they want. 
          
          For example, we could allow for staking stablecoin LP pairs to earn BTC-ETH LP pairs or gas token pairs. This allows for the automation of DCA.
          
          Another example is that we can take Tokens earned from a farm and deposit it into a DEX's single stake pool, earn TOKEN single staking pool. This in turn supports higher price, higher APYs, and higher TVL and results in a much stronger project and ecosystem.

          - Project Details
          Crystl Finance is a Yield Maximizer & Vaulting Platform on the Cronos, Polygon (Matic), and BNB blockchains. We offer Vaulting as a Service to DeFi and Blockchain projects as well as users in order to help them maximize their liquidity and earnings. Crystl Finance is listed on the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet app and we have partnered with multiple large partners including ApeSwap and Relay Chain to provide Vaults and build liquidity and we plan to do the same with the leading projects on KCC.
          
          Crystl Finance will bring new users and continued marketing to the Callisto Ecosystem. We have had over 180,000 site users in the past 3 months, and over 25,000 community members across our social media sites. These numbers will increase even further as we expand to multiple new blockchains. We will heavily market both the launch and all partnerships and updates we have on KCC in order to bring as many new users as possible.
