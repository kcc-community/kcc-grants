## üéØProject Overview

          - Overview
            We aim to teach and connect Africans on Blockchain and Blockchain development. Particular with us is the belief that a knowledge of Blockchain will play a central role for the new generation of Africans, and we aim to teach and educate them to be pioneers and builders.

          - Project Details
            Graate, as stated above, is an organization that aims to teach and arm the new generation of Africans (Nigeria as a primary focus area) with blockchain knowledge and training for the next generation of builders. 

            Our goal is to train entry to Mid-level developers on BlockchainBlockchain and to build on the KCC blockchain. We will be achieving this with KCC by providing content (Video and written) on building on the KCC blockchain, holding workshops in Universities in Nigeria, educating developers and students interested in blockchain development on building solutions on the KCC Blockchain. 

            Our innovation and blockchain evangelism culture feels like a perfect fit with KCC, thanks to your flexible structure and our shared visions to expand DeFi‚Äôs reach to the masses.

## üì°Future Plans
      We want Graate to build communities in all African countries and educate and empower outstanding African developers to make solutions that will impact the world. We will love to educate 1,000,000 developers in Africa on web3, blockchain development, and building solutions on the Blockchain. Africa has a lot of untapped potentials that we want to expose to the rest of the world. If awarded this grant, KCC will be our Blockchain of choice for building solutions on the Blockchain and teaching to the next billion innovators and builders of Blockchain in Africa. Our community of developers, users, and innovators will be a pool of ideas that will dictate the products and services that will run on the KCC blockchain and improve the lives of Africans and the world.
