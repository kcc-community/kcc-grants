## üéØProject Overview

          - Overview:
          Kupad is a platform for users discover and participate in new KCC projects.

          - Project Details:
          Kupad is meant to serve different needs for different people with tailored products. Kupad is very much
          like CoinMarketCap, except it is all about KCC. That gives KCC projects full un-contested visilibity, instead of competiting
          for visibility with other projects from other blockchains as compared to Coinmarketcap or Coingecko.
          
          For enthusiasts, Kupad's token listing is the place to discover, follow and participate in new and exciting projects on KCC.

          For developers, Kupad is a where to showcase your projects and to engage the KCC community. Listing is automated and instant,
          meaning there is not need to await for approval or pay fees. Anyone can list their tokens for free and instantly.
          
          Project listing gives new projects exposure to the community, increasing discoverability. In addition to gaining exposure,
          developer can quickly bootstrap a community for their new project by running airdrops to community members who complete 
          social tasks (such as join their discord / telegram channels, follow them on social media, share a post, re-tweet...).
          
          For investors and speculators, Kupad's token listing offers a place to discover potential gems early and to be able to 
          participate in them via our launchpad product.
