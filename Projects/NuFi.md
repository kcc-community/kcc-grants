## üéØProject Overview

          - Overview : NuFi https://nu.fi is a self-custody multi-chain wallet with hardware wallet support. NuFi has integrated Cardano, Ethereum, Solana, Flow, and  Milkomeda C1 blockchains with in-app functionality that includes staking, visual NFT gallery, DEX, cross-chain trading, and buying/selling using a credit card. We plan to add more EVM chains in the near future, and we‚Äôd like to focus on KCC as the next one.

          - Project Details : NuFi‚Äôs web wallet https://wallet.nu.fi is compatible with all browsers on all devices, while NuFi‚Äôs Chrome extension connects users to dApps on all supported blockchains. We are trying to bring users a complex crypto experience (similar to Binance) while keeping the user in full control and the highest security using non-custodial hardware wallets.

           - Legal Structure: NuFi Holding j.s.a. (company registered in Slovakia)

           - Team's experience: We built and still operate AdaLite.io (under NuFi umbrella), Cardano‚Äôs first light wallet, popular mainly among HW wallet crypto holders. Almost 30% of all ADA transacted in 2021 went through AdaLite (303 bil. ADA). We operate proof of stake validator nodes on Solana, Flow, Cardano and Milkomeda (over 35k delegators, ‚Ç¨250m delegated) which funded our project so far. We are long-term blockchain developers who worked on products for many known brands on different blockchains (Cardano, Ethereum, Flow, Solana). Experience with infrastructure (wallets, explorers) projects but also smart contracts (Dapps).(Worked for Dapper labs, IOHK, API3, dcSpark and more). Our developers work on Ledger and Trezor integrations for multiple blockchains.

## üì°Future Plans

      Our plan is to  implement ETH+EVM chains, together with popular non-EVM chains (Cardano, Solana, Flow..) and possibly add new popular standards(Cosmos IBC..), while maintain ease-of-use of singlechain wallet (like phantom or metamask). To wisely choose crypto tools, that we will implement (currently fiat on/off ramp, exchange, DEX), so users won't have to use centralized solutions in crypto anymore.
