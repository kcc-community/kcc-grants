üéØProject Overview

 - Overview
	
    RocketX is basically aggregating all the CEX and DEX to provide access to global liquidity at a single click with emphasis on Cross Chain Swaps to break the boundaries between the different chains. Today it is very complex for the user to toggle between different chains and keep up with so many chains coming up. We simplify crypto trading and make access to different chains simple with a really simple UI and an amazing UX. 

    In short, we can make KCC more accessible to the masses!
