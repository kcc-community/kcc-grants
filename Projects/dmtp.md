## 🎯Project Overview

          - Overview
            【What is DMTP】
            DMTP is the Web3 messaging protocol.
            You can send and receive messages based on your wallet address. The messages are E2EE (End-to-End Encryption), en / decrypted with your public/private keys so that no others, including DMTP, can see them.
            In Web3, all identities are transferred to the wallet address. In such a situation, there still needs to be an easy-to-use method of communication with the wallet address. However, there is no standard, and many people use Web2 applications.
            We would like to solve this and build a world complete with Web3 identities.

            【What you can do with DMTP】
            - Send notificaions to the walle addresses directly.
              Send liquidation notification to the user.
              Send update information to the all NFT holders.
              Send advertisement to the users who are active in on-chain.
            - Can create NFT holder only group chat
            - Users can communicate without getting information outside of Web3
