## üéØProject Overview 

  

- Overview: 

The first real solution for projects & high-ticket investors to get their native assets into the hand of investors without impacting the market price and to unlock development budget in a decentralized fashion, where ownership always remains with the asset holders.  The only decentralized post-launch fundraising option out there. 

  

- Project Details:  

The Frictionless-Platform is the one-stop solution for projects, vetted whales and normal investors to unlock the full power of custom native assets and tokenization as the basis for fundraising. It is a place to move assets without impacting the market price and with more flexibility than normal market orders. Users of our platform need not worry about centralization or malicious counterparties as ownership of funds remains with the asset holders and transactions are carried out through custom generated smart contracts.  

 

- Business Model: 

Outsourcing of technology  

Our tech is a standardized premium feature for projects and companies by integrating our Switching technology as a plug-and-play API that is integrated with their respective front ends. Offers can be created on-site, resulting in secure routing to our core backend.  

  

Liquidity transfer of decentralized exchanges 

Every protocol requires a large volume of traffic to be successful. Frictionless achieves this by partnering with decentralized exchanges and liquidity providers. Our platform enables projects to migrate their liquidity pool (LP) from one exchange to another without unlocking periods for LP's and any price impact. 

  

Tools for Market Makers 

So far traditional market makers were tackling the problem we aim to solve in a different manner, by strategically controlling the project‚Äôs asset prizes they represent to aggregate and govern a treasury for their customers. This drives volume and creates healthy asset order flow. When using our specialized tools Market Makers unlock additional means to guard an asset‚Äôs price. 

  

Switch Subscription Model‚ÄØ 

It is important to state that the default ‚ÄòSwitch‚Äô will be freely accessible for users of our platform. 

Projects and investors can choose between buying or subscribing to different Switch Usage plans to unlock full access to all features on our platform. These include a selection of additional ‚ÄòSwitches‚Äô to further assist projects and their investors. 

  

DAO Features  

To access the platform a minimum dollar value equivalent of our native token needs to be held to un-lock the first of five tiers. The more a wallet holds, the higher the tier and the more tokens can get allocated to offers by Offer-Creators or tokens switched by Contributors. Both sides can partake in our governance system at tier five. 

  

Per-Transaction-Fee-System 

Per transaction we will receive 2% fees in the traded assets, users have the option of using our FRIC token to reduce the fee to 1%.

## üì°Future Plans 

We are chain agnostic, and our solution applies to all chains out there. Through our community we will connect and grow a cross-chain community, benefiting everyone involved. Once we finish our Platform version 1.0 we already have a 1-year Roadmap planned, adding even more usability to our platform. (Provision of road map per request) For each chain that we deploy on we will have a dedicated development and business development team.  

Roadmap: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z61yedQbZSHpgv5RmlpppezYoev-vKtcCWPqG0JJQCQ/ 

Mainstream start-ups will soon face the same problem that tokenized projects are facing now, having their funds residing in their native assets, which they have to sell on the market to unlock their budgets. We will have a solution ready for them, tested, proven and implemented into the industry as the reliable default option. 

 

## üôãAdditional Information ‚ûï 

We are production ready in 6 months, granted the funding. Our solution benefits both the chain (traffic through us) plus new and existing projects, while aggregating new investors and users from other chains.
