## üéØProject Overview

          - Overview: Aldabra Finance is a new stablecoin AMM algorithm (based on formula x + y = K) that allows users to efficiently swap stablecoins without any slippage and price impact. Users can deposit stablecoins into the vault to receive interest and fee share as a stablecoin.  

          - Project Details:  

          Aldabra Finance was designed to solve three major problems:
             - Unnecessary loss by slippage and price impact when trading stablecoins.
             - Lack of opportunities to generate more yield from excessive liquidity.
             - Inflexibility to support new stablecoins in the single liquidity pool.  

          Aldabra Finance offers a solution to these three problems through three protocols:
             - Constant Swap allows users to efficiently swap stablecoins through the Aldabra Swap protocol, what is an automated market maker (AMM) that supports zero slippage and price impact.
             - Stable Pool introduces the STAL stablecoin was designed to be a USD-pegged stablecoin, which is fully backed by USD stablecoins that are flexible to add in the single liquidity pool.
             - the STAL Vault to earn fee share and interest from autonomously depositing stablecoins to decentralized lending protocols.

## üôãAdditional Information ‚ûï

          - Constant Swap:  
             - Swap Basics: Users can swap between stablecoins in the Stable pool that are pegged to the same value with a 1:1 ratio without any slippage and price impact. No matter what the trading value is $1 or $100,000, the price remains the same. The order will be fulfilled instantly as long as the Stable pool has enough liquidity.  

             - Swap Mechanics: The formula of invariant would determine the characteristics of the AMM: the formula of "x + y = k" can provide a fixed price.  

          - Stable Pool:  
             - Utility: The Aldabra Stable pool will be utilized in a lot of ways to stabilize and provide liquidity to the Aldabra ecosystem. Users can involve in the Aldabra ecosystem by depositing USD stablecoins into the Stable pool to mint new STAL stablecoin with a 1:1 ratio. Initially, STAL stablecoin can be used for stablecoin swapping and earning like other stablecoins.

             Stablecoins within the Stable pool will be divided into two parts by the dynamic stablecoin reserve (DSR) algorithm.  
             * 20% of each underlying stablecoin reserve for provide liquidity on the Aldabra Swap protocol.  
             * 80% autonomously deposit into decentralized lending protocols such as Alpaca and Venus for generating maximize yield.  

             - Flexibility:  
             The Aldabra Stable pool can be flexible to add a new underlying stablecoin in the Aldabra Stable pool that will maintain the efficiency of existing liquidity without creating new liquidity pools.  

             - Dynamic Stablecoin Reserve Algorithm:  
             The simple idea is the Stable pool will reserve 20% of each underlying stablecoin to provide liquidity and autonomously deposit 80% to decentralized lending protocols.  

             Dynamic stablecoin reserve (DSR) algorithm will perform to rebalance when:
             * The reserve is more than 30% of total balance; or
             * There is insufficient reserve for withdraw

          - STAL Vault:  
             The STAL Vault was designed to generate a native interest rate. This is achieved through the Aldabra smart contracts programmatically depositing the underlying stablecoins into decentralized lending protocols to generate yield. In addition, trading, minting and redemption fees generated through the Aldabra Stable pool and Swap protocol will be passed on to users holding deposits in the STAL Vault. (As interest and fees accrue, new STAL is minted and sent to the STAL Vault.)  

             When a user opts in to receive interest by depositing STAL tokens into the STAL Vault they will receive interest-bearing tokens (ibSTAL). These interest-bearing tokens will not have the value of the underlying stablecoins but will appreciate in value over time. Users can be withdrawn at any time, resulting in the user receiving their original deposit plus accrued interest.
