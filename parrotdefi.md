## üéØProject Overview

Parrot Defi is a decentralized yield farm project based on obtaining our reward token (PPEGG) by depositing other currencies and providing liquidity.
	
We've been excited about EVMs, and lately, we've successfully launched a Yield Farming platform on Arbitrum, Iotex, Polygon and Harmony, which reached $1,5M of TVL on its first 24h alive and 	nowadays is still growing it by implementing new features, the latest one being a burning vault called Incubator, meant to increase the value of its native token PPEGG.
	
KCC is currently in an excellent position to serve as the foundation of expansion for our platform due to its high speed and low transaction costs, in line with the true meaning of 	Decentralized Finance.  
	  
We aim to create a multichain yield farming platform based on a layered architecture that extends the regular farm‚Äôs life cycle, plus unique features that add value and use case to the token.
	
The Team believes in the concept of creating added value on KCC by proposing an ideal environment to add value to our investors' tokens through traditional yield farming products (tokens and 	pools) and new features and partnerships over time.
	
Being aware of the biggest challenges for most farms on DeFi, time and inflation. However, we've ended up with a simple solution to this, continuous development. We are committed to facing 	these challenges by dividing the farm's cycle into 2 phases; the first one being initial farming and minting, and the second, the establishment phase.
	
We have thought that a path of 2 weeks is ideal for the initial farming phase, followed by a second establishment phase where unique features and products are deployed progressively, adding 	value to the token.
	
Farming tokens do not have to be intended for an irrevocable price drop. That is why we have designed features to balance PPEGG inflation, having a low circulation supply and a medium 	emission rate.
	
Also, we'd like to allow small investors to maximize their profits through layered farming, allowing investors with smaller capital to grow their wealth during an extended period and 	incentivizing them to hold rewards instead of selling them.
	
We think that hold a token and accumulating rewards is the nature of farming, so we try to encourage and give different reasons to our investors to keep PPEGG in their portfolio either for 	future layered farming, for the payment of other currencies (Earn USDC), or as an exit currency for other projects (IFO) for example.
	
The market is large enough and with enough growth potential to support different layers of farming in the same project, as we are confident in growing our community as time goes on.

### Relevant Experience

 **Blockchain development**

  With several years of experience with react and solidity, our team isn't only capable of forking projects, but also developing functionalities and apps from scratch.

Our developers are also specialized in essential security measures, indispensable for the success of projects on the blockchain. These measures include testing and debugging, refactorization, gas spent optimizing, lintering, and many more.


**SEO**

Our SEO specialists have gained extensive experience working on projects in more than four languages distributed in nine countries.

We've noticed that most DeFi projects are not optimized for search engines because developers are not experts on this matter. Our team has seen an opportunity in the lack of competition and is confident in generating and redirecting traffic to specific projects and networks. The primary source of redirected traffic will come from post-writing, link-building, on-page optimization, and many more strategies.

  **Marketing and Community management**

  Wholly specialized in cryptographic projects promotion, our marketing team has not just used social media as a tool but has professionalized its use on them. Some of their strategies are segmentation of niche users and viral content creation. They can adapt the message to the receivers thanks to their comprehensive experience on these channels.


**Web and graphic design**
 

With lots of creativity and resourcefulness, our team can adapt to any kind of environment and project and add intrinsic value to it just through its designs. Their work is visible on current websites from well-reputed brands across Europe. NFTs is the latest skill they‚Äôve developed and matches perfectly the demands of the current blockchain users.

## üì°Future Plans
 As is explained in the roadmap and project description, the Team will constantly add new features and products to the platform. However, by any means, these smart contracts will be upgradeable through proxy contracts, migrator functions, or anything that could be potentially malicious or dangerous for users.
      

## üôãAdditional Information ‚ûï

Our goal is not only to reach a high TVL on our platform, our efforts will also be to focus on bringing the highest amount of users to the ecosystem by bringing new products and features. Naturally, this will affect the overall project's life cycle, which we anticipate to be longer than traditional farming projects.

  

The launchs of Parrot Defi on the different chains, has been followed by new actions that impacted the token's price, raising it. The measures designed to fight inflation were very well accepted by our community, making them burn more than 50% of the total supply.

  

We're entirely aware of which factors define the survival of a project in the long-term, being the main one, the token use-case. That's why we focus efforts continuously on developing and delivering new functionalities.

  

We've thoroughly analyzed a potential implementation of KCC in the Spanish Community, and we're confident saying that there is an excellent opportunity behind it. We would be happy to support you on that task, even beyond this project.
