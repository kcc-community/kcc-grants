## 🎯Project Overview

          - Overview
          
          Our main goal of the project is to create a decentralized gaming protocol that would not favor centralized campaigns’ over players/users and 
          would provide a fair mathematical basis for games with a 50/50 probability of winning.

          - Project Details
          
          We are developing a gaming protocol for the transfer of the usual gambling segment on the blockchain with a transparent model of operation (the 
          user plays with a pool of liquidity) 
          And for its ecosystem of P2P games (the user plays with the user and a smart contract acts as a guarantor of fair play)
          First of all this solution solves the problem of unfair chances to win, as well as accelerates all basic business processes such as billing, transaction speed and the ability not to fill out the KYC.

## 📡Future Plans

   We want to make a p2p game in a "cuphead" style and focus on a full-fledged game. 

   All other stochastic games are necessary for us to integrate into the online casino, to monetize our partners and ourselves

        We are also in active talks with strategic partners in the gaming industry about integrating our games into online casinos, where the strategic partner chooses the commission by buying tokens from us to distribute to its audience. We have already signed several MOUs in this direction.
