## 🎯Project Overview

          - Overview
          CO2C (CO2 Capture Coin) is a token (a cryptocurrency) that represents an amount of captured CO2.

          - Project Details

          ### CO2 Capture Point

          A CO2 capture point is a point where CO2 is removed from the atmosphere or release is prevented.

          Some examples of CO2 capture points are running solar panels, as measured by kWh produced, or sustainably managed forests, as measured by volume of lumber created.

          ### Proof of Concept

          We're currently working with a solar panel manufacturing company. They will be the first CO2 capture point that we onboard.

          The solar panel systems they set up use IoT devices to communicate back to the factory the amount of kWh generated by each panel. CO2C will be generated based on kWh's produced by each set of panels, and distributed back to the owners of those panels.

          ### Reaching Further

          We'll be finding an onboarding other carbon capture points, and working with other solar power companies.

## 📡Future Plans
      We'll be finding an onboarding other carbon capture points, and working with other solar power companies.  We'll be creating integrations for other IoT devices as well as carbon capture points.
      

## 🙋Additional Information ➕

      We like the stellar blockchain for its low carbon footprint, but the wallets are slightly confusing compared to Kucoin.  We'd like to know the carbon footprint of kucoin per transaction.

      We have questions with governance.  Currently, we have to certify each operation individually in order to reward CO2C - this is a manual process and done by Eduardo.  It can use things like meters and information from electric companies provided that the solar panels are attached to the grid.  I'm wondering how this process could maybe be moved to some kind of voting structure, so the CO2 Capture Foundation could become democratized.  I hope you can discuss this with me.
