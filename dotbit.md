          .bit provides a globally unique account system with the .bit suffix. The leading technical architecture of .bit allows both blockchain and non-blockchain users to use it without permission. .bit’s “cross-chain” feature is achieved in a way of cryptography-level security. As a DID system, .bit meets the ultimate requirements of Web3.0.
          .bit makes your asset transfer more convenient and secure. It can serve as the unified username in different Dapps. It can be used as a portal for Dapps. It provides you with a decentralized personal homepage (.bit.cc). It bridges the gap between Web2.0 and Web3.0.
          .bit comes in various languages such as hi.bit, 你好.bit, こんにちは.bit, 🚀🌕.bit, 안녕하세요.bit, Привет.bit and bonjour.bit.
          In the first 7 months upon launch, .bit has seen over 30k unique addresses registered with 72k accounts. Major Wallets and dApps such as TokenPocket, imToken, HyperPay, Huobi Wallet, Alpha Wallet, BitKeep, NFTGO, NFTSCAN, etc. have integrated the .bit SDK. users can transfer any digital currency by entering .bit directly into these wallets.

## 📡Future Plans
.bit's goal is to bring DID to everyone. We will use it to drive .bit integration in the KCC ecosystem DApp and also to feed registered users from the KCC ecosystem, for example by offering them a better price for signing up.
.bit's unique Reverse Record capabilities enhance the security of user-contract interactions and reduce fraud within the KCC ecosystem. 
.bit will deploy contracts on KCC. At the same time, .bit has been widely integrated by many wallets and DApps, etc. compared to other similar products, which can bring the most direct and real value to KCC ecology.
      

## 🙋Additional Information ➕

We expect hundreds of accounts to be created per day once the KCC ecosystem is properly informed about the opportunities of integration .bit brings. 
As the .bit product and community grows, it can also bring thousands and tens of thousands of users to the KCC ecosystem.
