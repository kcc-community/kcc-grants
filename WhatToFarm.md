## üéØ Project Overview

Overview:

**Node Infrastructure for KCC business:**
- trace Mode KCC Node
- archive Mode KCC Node
- web hooks event for KCC node
     
**Node Infrastructure for KCC business:**
- charts
- KCC assets portfolio with transactions tracker
- price and liquidity alerts
- token & smart contracts (pools, farms, NFTs) info
- hot&new tokens list
          
**Project Details:**

We scan all smart contracts directly from blockchain, quickly parse them into an array of data on the backend and display them in a user-friendly interface. We've created supercool technology that processes information from more than 500k smart contracts in real-time, and all new blockchains and contracts are added to the database automatically. We have our own data source, so we analyze prices and liquidity, and build charts quickly and accurately. We‚Äôre all about getting our users direct access to liquidity data from all blockchains and DeFi pools in real-time.

**Team Profiles:**

CEO: Dima Dolgov, 38, IT entrepreneur with 20+ years of experience in web product development. Since 2016 co-founder and leader of the Bankex Lab, largest smart contract lab on the market, where tokenization, NFT, ETH Layer 2, Wrapped Tokens and other DeFi technologies are being researched. Author of one of the first tokenization whitepapers. Created the first ETH Layer 2 solution - Plasma, the first Web3Swift lib and other open-source projects.

**Team's experience:**

Our engineers have great experience in cryptocurrency development. For more than 5 years the team has been working together and developing products and projects of different areas of the crypto market. Fullstack developers of the team have experience in creating custodial and native cryptocurrencies, writing smart contracts in Solidity, building tokenomics and DAO and DEX archetypes. We own blockchain nodes and provide them as a service(saas) to other developers.

**Team Code Repos:**

We have created 90 open-source repositories and 251 private repositories with software for the blockchain market. The open-source repositories have over 1000 stars on the githab.
 
## üèÜDevelopment Roadmap

**Overview**

Our main goal is the rapid development and growth of the KCC blockchain ecosystem. To solve this problem, first of all we need to create a comfortable experience for users and developers. Users need the simplest information - price charts, information about tokens, useful utilities. For developers we need good interfaces for working with nodes and blockchain.

## üì°Future Plans

We believe in the significant growth of the DeFi market and look forward to contributing our engineering skills to the KCC blockchain team. We make infrastructure and products for users, and our validation nodes are among the best in technical specifications. Our main goal is to become a KCC blockchain validator, it would be a great honor for our team.
